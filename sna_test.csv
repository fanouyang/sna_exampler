A,B,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"Article title: Growing Sweet on TomatoesThis article talks about the use of biotechnology in the agriculture industry in order to make tomatoes grow sweeter tomatoes. Scientists in Japan successfully grew a batch of these tomatoes by increasing the sugar content in the tomato genome. They did this by identifying that the tomato gene is very similar to the tobacco gene, uORF. When this gene is removed in tobacco there is an increase in sucrose levels in tobacco leaves. So, scientists removed this gene from tomatoes, modified it with a gene called E8 and then placed it back into the tomato. The result was that the tomatoes contained 50% more sucrose and higher levels of amino acids. Scientists are continuing to develop this process to make it more widely applicable.神After doing some research I found that biotechnology is used in agriculture in a number of ways. I think that the obvious ethical debate here is that the food we eat is being genetically modified through science, which is not natural. However, the counterargument would be that much of the food we eat is cover with pesticides which is another process used to help farmers produce food. I think that generally Americans are starting to realize the negative effects of pesticides and therefore any sort of science that is transforming their foods could turn them off. I personally think I would rather eat a natural tomato vs. one that is grown and modified in a lab.Journal reference: G. H. M.

I understand wanting to produce bigger tomatoes or a bigger crop, but why make a tomato sweeter? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of eating a tomato? I definitely agree with you that I would rather eat a natural tomato and I kind of feel like people should be putting their biotechnology efforts into things that effect the health or longevity of society and not changing things that people already like. I like how you mentioned that Americans are starting to realize the negative effects of these sciences because it makes me a little nervous to think of all the chemicals and artificial things we put into our bodies and what it will do to the population in the future.神",2,0,3,0,0,Week 13,2,1

C,E,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"This is very true, what you say about how Americans are shying away from pesticides in their food. I was walking through Target on Saturday morning, and I found that about half of each food aisle seemed to exclude神GMOs, and more USDA organic foods. There has been a significant shift away from foods being modified, and people heavily debate on whether or not GMOs are actually harmful. The Environmental Working Group is a non-profit, non-governmental, widely known source for providing lists of the foods神that are most affected (the ""Dirty Dozen"") and the least affected. Most fruits and vegetables with tough outer skins are less affected, and more meat (because they ingest certain vegetables and grass) and神softer fruits and veggies are heavily affected in turn.Here is the EWG's website, in case you wanted to look even further: http://www.ewg.org/",3,0,2,0,0,Week 13,2,1
E,E,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"Article: New Insights into Protein Structure Could Change the Future of Biomedicine神The article I found has really cool information on a new protein that could be designed to be extremely stable, withstand many conditions, and be used for personalized medicines. The writer explains how cancer and arthritis medications are effective, but have some severe side effects. With this new proposed structure of a protein they would be able to more precisely target and kill the bad cells possibly without damaging other parts of the body (the ones that cause the side effects). The real problem with trying to design these proteins is that they have to be perfect and it is extremely hard to incorporate all the different factors associated with proteins in the human body. However, Professor Meiering and her colleagues are confident that they accounted for all of the factors and created a protein that could change the future of medicine and biotechnology.神This topic is really interesting to me because it is so impressive that something as natural and tiny as a protein can be designed and synthesized to have certain functions. The only downfall is that with synthesizing and/or changing something that is so natural, there are many ethical issues that arise. At least these improvements are to better society and create a better way of living for people with illnesses.

E,D,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"The Article: Is In Vitro Meat the Future of Food?BY AARON THIER神SEPTEMBER 28, 2015神I found an interesting article that In vitro meat may become our future food. According to the article, there are almost one billion people who consume an inadequate amount of protein, and the demand for high-qualified protein will increase over the time approximately 73 percents. However, the livestock operation cannot be expanded to meet this rising demands that about 26 percents of our land are used to pasture animals, 1/3 of our arable lands are cultivated for feeding those animals. Considering that this amount is already huge enough to yield more lands for the animals, satisfying human desire to possible protein goal looks difficult. This is the basis of arousing the In vitro meat. the definition of In vitro meat is a muscle tissue that we can produce it from the stem-cell. In vitro meat is estimated as one of the most eco-friendly technique because this technique does not need any requirement for pasturing the livestocks. For example, according to the article, the chickens need to eat about two pounds of grain to gain one pound of live weight. Pigs require around four pounds, and cattle, the most ecologically harmful, require about seven pounds. The lower the protein content of the feed, the more an animal needs to eat. Grass-fed cows are the most inefficient of all and contribute the largest amounts of greenhouse gas. If we神introduce In vitro meat technology to our common life, we may achieve big flourishing. However, currently, there are several concerns that we have to solve. First, In vitro meat technology is in laboratory outcome that we still need some time to make it神stabilized and after, we can make deal with the market. Another problem is that this technology can harm on the神economics for livestocks. Considering that a lot of livestock holders will lose their profit, and may exit from the livestock market. Third, there may a lot of people protest on this meat that In vitro meat is synthesized meat, not a nature one. We cannot estimate how it will神influence on our health that side-effects can神overwhelm the total profit from this technology.I personally think In vitro meat神technology is a big revolution which leads the human population神growth increased. Protein is the most important nutrient for any other animals including us that if we meet the adequate amount of protein for the people, there will be more benefits神than harms. In utilitarianism, which insist the greatest神happiness of greatest number, we must develop this technology continuously to lower the cost of producing. After that, we can try any effect of this food神to someone volunteer to be a experiment.

G,F,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"Article Title:""Proteus picks UK for 'smart pill' production and testing""This article is about a new biotechnology known as the ""smart pill."" This idea is that any pill taken would have a monitor in it that would give feedback to a patch worn by the subject taking the pill. It is not battery powered or antenna-using, but rather receives its power from reacting with stomach fluids. The feedback would include exact time of ingestion, feedback of vitals, heart rate tracker, and other measurements. The sensor in the patch worn by the patient then uses bluetooth functions to send the information it received to the hospital computers. This technology has already received European and U.S. approval.神I wanted to speak on the ethical implications of the smart pill. First of all, if there was a way to receive accurate, real-time updates on what is going on in the body of a patient I believe most people would approve of this. However, the idea of putting a sensor in something that is ingested in the body is scary for most. I believe that having that data on some patients and being able to be constantly monitoring their vitals will be key. I don't see any ethical implications too large to stop this idea from flourishing, because as long as there are no side effects then its only positives resulting. Something I thought that was cool too was that it tracked when the pills were ingested and so overdosing and abuse of pills would not be a factor. The pills are only being used in hospital settings, but if this technology could be translated into all pills taken, then in theory, there could be a real-time tracking system of pharmaceutical abuse. When I read this article I could think of several ethical problems that could result, but these are not so large scale that there would be major protest.",2,0,0,0,0,Week 13,2,0

The only ethical concern, which is the same as most other biotechnologies, is that it is extremely experimental. This technology has not been around for very long, and therefore should be a cause for concern.

F,G,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"Article title:神Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research神The article talks about the human stem cell research and ethical issues. The stem cell is a unique and essential cell type found in animal body. Stem cells divide and become specific types神such as heart, muscles, blood, and brain cells. Also, some of the stem cells remain and are used to repair when the specific organs get damaged. The important thing of stem cell is that stem cells can reproduce themselves and repair the damaged parts throughout an individual's life. For that reason, scientists have researched stem cell to use medical purpose. There are several types of stem cells; embryonic stem cell (ES), Adult stem cell (AS), and embryonic germ cell (EG). AS cells are already differentiated cell, so it has limited ability whereas ES and EG are originated from early stage of embryo and from developing fetus, respectively. ES and EG has ability to develop into nearly any cell type, so the incurable disease can be treated with ES and EG. However, researching human stem cell has a lot of limitation. Generally, human embryos are respected as a form of human life, but that it is hard to determine from what stage of embryo should be respected as a form of human life. Additionally, researching human embryo is to cure the incurable disease and save human lives. There are thousands of people suffering from AIDS, cancer, and many other diseases and disorders, and researching human embryos is one of the possible treatment for them.神https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/23",1,0,0,0,0,Week 13,2,0

B,A,4322058,Week 13 discussion: Ethics of Biotechnologies,"Article Title: ""Look into my Eyes""神This article is all about Smart Contact Lenses. Originating from Universities on the West Coast, smart lenses were designed to help those with eye related diseases, like Glaucoma. These contact lenses contain conductive wires that constantly monitor pressure and fluids in the eyes. As the use of these lenses becomes possible, they also are researching ways that these lenses can actually dispense medicine into the eye, or even make it easier to see by adding light. The first product is already on the market, and it is called Triggerfish. Triggerfish is meant to just help people with Glaucoma, though now that they have a working version for that, they have been experimenting with other possible uses for the lenses.Ethically, Smart Contact Lenses are a good idea. Medicine is always changing, and as more technology is developed, people are itchy to have an easier way to get something done. Monitoring a disease is one of those things that has always been a difficult part of life, and technology is slowly making diseases easier to handle. 神This type of technology can monitor your body and realize that something is going wrong way before you even realize it yourself and have irreversible damage. 神As for now, this product could mean a good future for those with glaucoma, but it still has it's share of problems. It is still considered an invasion on the body to put anything new in it, and the body has proven to start rejecting the lenses after a short period of time.
